# shop
A shopping cart micro-app. Built primarily to refresh my Typescript skills.

# Installation
To install, clone the repo into your local machine. Then, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` to run a development build of the project. You can find the other commands in the `package.json` file.

# Purpose
I built this project to brush up on my Typescript skills, so it's nothing too ground breaking. But it was fun to build.
